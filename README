lua-Coat : Yet a Another Lua Object-Oriented Model
==================================================

    Language shapes the way we think,
    and determines what we can think about.
        -- B.L. Whorf

Introduction
------------

Perl5, like [Lua][], has no OO model, just OO mechanism.
This allows a proliferation (or experimentation) of different model.

Now with [Moose][], Perl5 find its _ultimate_ OO model.
Moose borrows all the best features from Perl6, CLOS (LISP), Smalltalk
and many other languages.
Moose is built on top of a metaobject protocol, with full introspection.

[Coat][] is light-weight Perl5 module which just mimics Moose.

Finally, lua-Coat is the Lua port of Coat.

Small lua patches allow a syntax close to Perl5 Moose. See patch/.

Documentation
-------------

There are few HTML files in doc/.

There are many unit tests in test/.

Moose supplies a Manual and a Cookbook available on
its [CPAN page](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/).
It's the best ressource to understand this module.

Development
-----------

lua-Coat uses Git as Version Control System
and is hosted at <http://github.com/fperrad/lua-Coat/>.
